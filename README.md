# FisuTankki

Fun little side project made with LibGDX and LibKTX.  
Orginally this was supposed to be calm and relaxing fish tank simulation using [the Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) as base concept.  
But as my place holder graphics looked like peppermint candy, I thought it was kinda funny.  
So now it is simulation about floacking peppermint candies.  

## To get things running
1.Clone this repo.  
2.Open it in Android studio  
3.Build -> Build APKs  
4.Go to: "your git root"\android\build\outputs\apk\debug  
5.There is your new and nice Apk ready to be carried to your phone.  
6.Open the app "FisuTankki" and relax.  

## Some notes
If you want more or less fish to be on screen at one time, there is variable amountOfFishes in GlobalVariables.kt (row 35).  
There put any number you think your phone (or emulator) can handle.  

This App does not have any controlls because thouse would ruin the relaxing feeling that is just watching peppermint candies floacking.
